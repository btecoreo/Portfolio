									<p>I structured a plan for all my CPD professional development activities. These all were done alongside my university work to adhere to my game development goal. </p>

									<h2>Short Term CPD Activities:</h2>

									<h3><strong>How to Prepare for Interviews (1 hour)</strong>, Workshop – 25/03/25 </h3>
									<p>In a room, an employment support member guided us through a PowerPoint advocating how to prepare for an interview. Interviews are an important part of getting jobs, as employers always view you face-to-face rather than on paper. She shared tips like researching your employer and the company, and what to say when asked challenging questions.</p>
									<p>The first time I did a job interview, I was completely stuck on questions and didn't prepare. These tips showed me exactly what to do for next time and how to approach questions I could not answer.</p>  
									<p>My next step is to use the NTU employibility tool Interview360 to practice what I have learnt and get feedback.</p>
									
									<h3><strong>CV Support (2 hours)</strong>, NTU Employability Tool – 10/05/25 </h3>
									<p>An online builder that tells you step by step what to do in each stage of your CV. Then provides you with a template. Afterwards, I used CV360 to get direct feedback on it. This taught me what to include and not to, as well as preferred company structures.</p>
					
									<p>This activity made me realise writing a CV is not as hard as I believed it would be. Tips like changing your CV to what you’re applying for have helped massively, and my next steps are creating more CVs based on my future career.</p>

									<h3><strong>Interview Support (3 hours)</strong>, NTU Employability Tool – 14/05/25 </h3>
									<p>Following on from CV support, this activity provided mock interviews and questions to mimic what it is like in an interview and get instant feedback. </p>
									<p>I currently have interviews coming up and I will use my practice and learnt techniques during them. </p>  
									<p></p>

									<h3><strong>Unitemps Employability (1 hour)</strong>, Workshop – 15/05/25 </h3>
									<p>An opportunity to ask a Unitemps worker for any queries or questions you have when getting a apart job. Getting a part-time job gives me experience in working in diverse fields and gaining skills from them. As well as permitting financial stability, for me to pursue my career. </p>
									<p>I had a 1:1 chat with an assistant, listing out paid work I can do alongside my studies that fit my criteria. I can either work on campus or through Unitemps, which shows part-time jobs in local employers.</p>  
									<p>It is always good to have a side income while in pursuit of a career. My dream is to be able to have two jobs, and I can practice this by working part-time alongside my studie</p>

									<h3><strong>All below courses have provided certfications upon completion</strong></h3>
									
									<h3><strong>Disability and the Workplace (3 hours)</strong>, NTU Learning Programme – 23/04/25 </h3>
									<p>This empowers and gives you confidence in your disability in the workplace. It gives confidence to people who have been afraid to discuss their disability when applying for work, or the job won’t meet their needs. This programme develops confidence for disabled students to apply for jobs and talk about their disability if required.</p>
									<p>There was the option to complete certain modules, but I did all 5, as disability in the workplace is something I am interested in. I have received access support during all my years in school, such as taking an exam in a separate room. Knowing  I can let employers know my requirements is reassuring. </p>  
									<p>For my next steps, I will be more open about sharing disability requirements with future employers. </p>

									

									<h3><strong>Developing your Social Awareness (1 hour)</strong>, LinkedIn Learning Course – 14/05/25 </h3>
									<p>Emotional intelligence can help you build strong relationships at work and adapt to changing environments. This course contained videos explaining emotional intelligence (EQ), on how important it is to be in touch with your emotions and social awareness. It additionally gave ways to identify triggers that prompt you to appear less emotionally intelligent.  </p>
									<p>This is very important for me as I struggled with mental health problems, mainly anxiety. And mainly because of exam stress. Because of this, I would have emotional outbursts toward myself or the people around me. Simple tips like identifying that I am in an emotional moment right now, why I am and reassessing the situation on whether my response is the best or not have helped me in my relationships </p>  
									<p>Next time I am stressed and anxious, I will reread the notes I have written down. I will also watch more programmes from Dr. Gemma Leigh Roberts, as her videos are very calming and informative.</p>

									<h3><strong>Strategic Communication and Teamwork (5 hours)</strong>, Santander Open Academy Course – 22/03/25 </h3>
									<p>This course gives you clear tips and soft skills to help you in team environments, build trust and influence others effectively. Advancing communication skills, which are often not very strong in computer developers.</p>
									<p>During this course, I watched videos and did interactive lessons, readings and personal activities. After each session, a quiz was made testing you on the knowledge given, and you must pass in order to move on to the next session.</p>  
									<p>I want to be a computer games developer, and for this I will often have to work in a team setting. These soft skills will help me build confidence in working in teams of people I have never met before to reach the same goal. </p>

									<p> I plan to implement these strategies in real world settings and build stronger relationships with the people around me and more cohesive teams. </p>
									
									<h3><strong>Python (5 hours)</strong>, Santander Open Academy Course – 05/04/25 </h3>
									<p>This very interactive course guides you through the fundamentals of Python and provides videos explaining programming concepts such as data structures, functions and control structures. During the course, you are aided in making your own program from scratch. </p>
									<p>Python was the first every programming language I learnt, and solidifying my knowledge on its concepts will help me in industrial work.</p>  
									<p>This course was very informative and I plan to use likewise ways to C# and how to code in Unity.</p>

									<h3><strong>Introduction to Generative AI (5 hours)</strong>, Santander Open Academy Course – 08/04/25 </h3>
									<p>This course is an introduction to modern AI, its history and applications. It aids people who have no clue about artificial intelligence. Knowing about AI is meaningful as it is becoming increasingly popular and changing the modern world. I was taught information about the history of AI and how Generative AI is implemented in business operations. There were also many modules about experimenting with AI history, health care AI, etc.</p>
									<p>I was not aware of the great impact of AI in our world. This gives me an idea of everything and will help me in the future of tech as AI is especially important in my field. </p>  
									<p>I will do more courses and research on AI as I find the topic very interesting and insightful.</p>

									<h3><strong>Google: Artifical Intelligence and Productivity (5 hours)</strong>, Santander Open Academy Course – 10/04/25 </h3>
									<p>This course improves your productivity with AI. Many times AI is seen as a "cheat code"; however, AI can greatly build your business and excel your studies or career when used productively. Digital skills on how to use AI were provided so you can understand its technology despite having no prior knowledge of AI. And ways you can use AI productively in your everyday tasks. </p>
									<p>This helped me as I used to be fully against the use of AI, but now I've integrated it into my everyday tasks, and it has simplified a lot of things for me. As simple as what I should eat for dinner, that will help my health to create content in AI I can use in my programming. I am less resistant to incorporating it into my everyday life.</p>  
									<p><strong>Total Hourse Gained: 31 hours</strong></p>
									
					
								

									<h2>Long Term CPD Activities:</h2>
									<h3><strong>Cheerleading</strong>, Sports Club</h3>
									
									<p>Like mentioned, I am a member of the Cheer team at university. Cheer is all about team building, helping eachother when stunts don't go your way and always keeping a positive mindset. It introduced new soft skills such as resilience and courage and I can not begin to explain how it has changed my outlook on many things.</p>
