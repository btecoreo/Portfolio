										<h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />
									<p>For professional and academic settings, professional conduct is crucial. I take extra care to uphold the highest standards of honesty, morality, and accountability as a student. This involves working with others, submitting original work, contributing thoroughly, and attending lectures on time. </p>
									<p>Through out this module I have:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Attended workshops and events regularly</li>
										<li>Engaged in CPD activities while doing wider research</li>
										<li>Demonstrated my clear commitment to my personal and professional growth</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Unprofessional conduct has lasting negative effects. This might mean lost learning opportunities, reduced grades, and weakened relationships with lecturers and peers. This might damage my credibility and employability in the future. Unprofessional behaviour might result in little equity in collaborative assignments, destroying team harmony. Teamwork is especially crucial in game development, and the unreliability of one person can impact the whole group's performance.</p>

									<p>Furthering my research, I read the BCS code of conduct. Through it I have learnt the importance of respecting privacy and data protection, acting with integrity, promoting equality, diversity, and inclusion and much more. These principles guide not only how I interact with others but also how I approach my work style and career. </p>

									

									<p>To succeed in a profession, particularly team based, fast moving industries like game development, I have behaviours I would like to further develop:</p>
									<ul>
									  <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Though I have self confidence, I struggle a bit speaking clearly in front of a wide audience. I need to become more comfortable in presenting my ideas as I will probably be experiencing team meetings or project pitches.</li>
									  <li><strong>Stress and Time Management:</strong> Managing pressure during deadlines, especially around exams or assignments, is an area I am actively working on but have improved extensively from the past.</li>
									 
									  <li><strong>Professional Digital Appearance:</strong> Writing formal emails and maintaining an appropriate online presence and digital footprint are important behaviours to practice as it may impact my ability to acquire career oppurtunities.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Developing these behaviours will help ensure I meet industry standards and become a reliable teammate for my work enviroment.</p>
									<p>That is the end of my portfolio, thank you so much for joining my journey in becoming a future computer games developer.</p>
