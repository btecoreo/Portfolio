									<p>Through my studies and independent development, I have gained valuable technical and professional skills. Below is a structure of my skill set in reflection of my current abilities, with evidence from my academic and extracurricular achievements:</p>
									<h3>Technical Skills</h3>

									<ul>
									  <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> I have strong mathematical capabilities, earning high grades in secondary and college, as well as a first in my recent Maths test for my Computer and Technology university module.</li>
									  <li><strong>Python (intermediate):</strong> I have developed several games on Python using the library Pygame and included OOP principles, file handling, user interaction logic and graphical concepts. Additionally, I had the opportunity to sell these games on the platform Fiverr.</li>
									  <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> I am a highly imaginative and innovative person. I have painted countless art pieces and studied art through my secondary and college years. My skill in art is reflected in my grades, gaining a 9 in GCSE and an A at A Level.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h3>Professional Skills</h3>
									<ul>
									  <li><strong>Communication and Teamwork:</strong> Improved through customer service roles and CPD courses, such as Strategic Communication and Teamwork. I am also a member of the Cheerleading sport club at university, which emphasises team building and discipline.</li>
									  <li><strong>Emotional Intelligence:</strong> Emotional Intelligence:  Strengthened through the Developing Your Social Intelligence LinkedIn Learning course, helping me manage anxiety and build resilience.</li>
									</ul>
									
									
									<p>All those skills above are key in what I need for my career aspirations, aligning with the principles required for Computer Game Development within a team.</p>
